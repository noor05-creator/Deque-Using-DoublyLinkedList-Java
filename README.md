# Deque Using Doubly Linked List in Java

This repository contains an implementation of a **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)** using a custom **Doubly Linked List** in Java. It supports insertion and deletion from both ends with efficient pointer manipulation.

## 🚀 Features

- `pushFront(int data)` – insert element at the front
- `pushBack(int data)` – insert element at the rear
- `popFront()` – remove element from the front
- `popBack()` – remove element from the rear
- `isEmpty()` – check if the deque is empty
- `print()` – display all elements from front to rear

## 💡 Learning Focus

This project is part of my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey. It deepens understanding of:
- Doubly linked list pointer mechanics
- Efficient queue operations from both ends
- Edge case handling (like empty deque, single-element deque)

## 📂 File Structure

- `Node` – defines a doubly linked node with `prev`, `next`, and `data`
- `deque` – class that handles all deque operations
- `Main` – contains sample usage and tests

## 🛠️ Built With

- Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
